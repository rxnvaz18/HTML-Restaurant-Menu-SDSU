                    <p>At our flagship location of San Marcos, we were inspired by the shoreside community to share our love for Thai cuisine.
                    Our dishes are in the style of southwestern Thai cuisine, where we create the perfect balance of citrus and spice. Our fish 
                    is freshly caught every morning and prepared to excite your tastebuds. San Marcos being a hub of fresh farmers' markets, we
                    decided to open our first restaurant and have opened at many other locations since.</p> 
                    
                    <p>We are a family-owned restaurant of former fishermen who have a passion for the culinary arts. Here at H-Thai-ML we know fresh is 
                    best. Therefore, we use only local and organic ingredients. We will even cook fish you catch yourself!
                    Our specialty dishes are our fresh and healing Tom Kha Coconut soup, and our expertly developed curries.</p> 

                    <p>Come enjoy healthy foods that are fragrant and delicious!
